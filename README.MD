Photon owns the characteristics of quanta and electromagnetic. Light speed is its physics
constant. The universe consists of photons. So the photon’s physics characteristic and constant
affect the universe’s physics law and constant. If the whole universe consists of many small
universes, the photon’s physics characteristic and constant in each small universe affect the
physics law and constant of this small universe. No matter what circumstance it is, anything
happening in the universe seems that its evolution is based on the science laws. All these are
affected by photon’s physics characteristic and constant. It is the direction for people of modern
physics to study photon’s physics characteristic and constant.
